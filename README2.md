## Hi there 👋

Advised by [Bowen Du (杜博文)](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/7285.htm), I received my bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) at Beihang University (北京航空航天大学计算机学院). 

Under the guidance of my advisor [Xi Xiao (肖喜)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xx_443/main.htm) and co-advisor [Shutao Xia (夏树涛)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm), I received my master's degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University (清华大学计算机科学与技术系). 

Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University (清华大学清华-伯克利深圳学院), fortunately, to be mentored by [Xiao Li (肖皪)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xl/main.htm) and co-advised by [Max Shen (申作军)](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). 

My research interest includes reinforcement learning, recommeder systems, ad bidding, social network. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international AI conferences such as AAAI, ICRA, ICAPS, ICASSP, ICWS, ICME.
